# **Support Vector Regression**

SVR regressor for Salary blaff checking.

The model performed in a good manner, although it seems like the polynomial regression model had a better fit for all of the data of the dataset (including the CEO salary).

The SVR model in sklearn, however, does not include feature scaling by default, hence, it was required to **feature scale** the matrices into two different objects and used them accordingly for the salary position prediction.
