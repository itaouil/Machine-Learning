# **Polynomial Regression**

Right. Polynomial regression is a regression analysis used when differently from the type of regression seen in the previous branch (simple and multiple linear regression) the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is modelled by an nth degree polynomial equation in the form of:

- y = b0 + x*b1 + x^2*b2 + ..... + x^nth*bn

That is all I got for you.

For more implemtation info check the python file.
